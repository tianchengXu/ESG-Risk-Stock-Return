# ESG-Risk-Stock-Return
Understanding Impact of ESG Risk Exposures on Short-term Stock Returns

Performed ETL on 5-year ESG and stock data from RepRisk, CRSP, Yahoo and Bloomberg; visualized data distribution with Tableau; conducted hypothesis testing on average 5-/10-/30-day excess returns grouped by credit rating; built Linear Regression and Fama-French Three-factor models on stock vs. market returns and evaluated coefficients; discovered significant evidence that high-credit-rating companies underperform in the short-term compared to low-credit-rating ones after exposures to ESG risks.
